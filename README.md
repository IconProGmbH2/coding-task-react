# Coding Task React

## Introduction

To create the frontend of our software, we use the JavaScript framework React. To accomplish the task in our UI team it is necessary to understand the behavior of React and how it can be used.
The goal of this assignment is to show that you can use React to build a small frontend project. The task is to create a simple software to create and list support tickets from customers. There are two pages to create.

## Tasks
1. The input form, where the customer can add the following information Name, Surname, Company, Email and a larger text to describe his problem. When the user clicks the submit button, it should be checked that all the fields are populated with a value and then stored in a local list.
2.	The list of support tickets should be displayed on a second page where all the information that a user can insert should be displayed. 
3.	Users should be able to switch between the two pages by clicking on a menu at the top of the page

## Hints
-	You don't need to worry about access for this problem. It is perfectly fine for someone to submit information and see the list of tickets.
-	Also, don't worry about storing the data. Itâ€™s totally fine if all the information is deleted after the server is shut down.
-	We will provide a small project directory with a necessary project body for you to start working on.

## Installation
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Clone the repository and move into it.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Afterwards run `npm run dev` to start the development server

When every step of the installation was successfull you can start your task. Happy Coding ðŸ˜Š
